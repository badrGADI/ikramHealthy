## The Power of Raw Honey
Raw honey is not just a sweetener; it's a powerhouse of **antioxidants**, **enzymes**, and **minerals**. Unlike refined sugar, raw honey has a lower glycemic index and contains antibacterial properties.

## Nuts: The Perfect Partner
Nuts like almonds, walnuts, and cashews are packed with:
*   **Healthy Fats:** Essential for brain health.
*   **Protein:** For muscle repair and satiety.
*   **Fiber:** For digestive health.
