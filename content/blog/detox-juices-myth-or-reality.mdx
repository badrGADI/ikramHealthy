The term "detox" is often thrown around in the wellness industry, but what does it really mean? Can a juice cleanse truly reset your body?

## The Body's Natural Detox
First, it's important to understand that your body has its own highly efficient detoxification system: your **liver** and **kidneys**. They work 24/7 to filter toxins from your blood.

## How Juices Help
While juices don't create a "detox" process that doesn't already exist, they can support your body's natural functions by:
1.  **Giving Digestion a Break:** Juices are easy to digest, allowing your energy to be used elsewhere.
2.  **Flooding with Micronutrients:** Green juices are packed with chlorophyll, vitamins, and minerals that support liver function.
3.  **Hydration:** Staying hydrated is key to flushing out toxins.

## Conclusion
Think of green juices not as a magic cure, but as a powerful tool to support your body's natural resilience.
